QUESTION 3

lines 4,5: move int variables inside main function

MULTIPLE OCCURRENCE (lines 7,11,12,17,20,23,29,32): remove spaces before/after argument

MULTIPLE OCCURRENCE (lines 12,14,17,21,22,24): fix brackets to be on a new line after if/else if/else statement and also on a new line after body

MULTIPLE OCCURRENCE (lines 13,27): remove dumb comments

MULTIPLE OCCURRENCE (lines 12,13,14,17,18,19,21,22,23,24): make body of statement easier to read, aka on a separate line from brackets

// the -x flag of less would be helpful to help indenting each body of a statement, it would make it much more efficient and easier
